No longer functional in places where Binance doesn't operate.

The theory behind this script is that stablecoins should be pegged to a certain value. However in reality the stablecoins see slight fluctuations and since they should be pegged to a certain value, you can assume
the price of the coin will frequently return to it's pegged price. Thus it is very easy to see if a coin is over/undervalued which brings upon a arbitrage opportunity. 

Of course in reality this relatively simple script is probably not the most effective investment strategy for several reasons including lack of opportunities due to trading fees and stablecoins not actually being risk-free
(Like how some believe USDT to be a sort of ponzi).
